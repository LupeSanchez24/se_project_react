# React + Vite : WTWR (What to Wear?)

About the Project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with th daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
